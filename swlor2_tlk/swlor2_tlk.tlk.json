This function of the Investigate skill does not give the character clues where none existed before. It simply allows the character to extract extra information from a clue he or she has found.  The character can collect and prepare evidentiary material for a lab (DC 15). This use of the Investigate skill requires an evidence kit (a penalty of -4 applies without a kit).  This function of the Investigate skill does not provide the character with evidentiary items. It simply allows the character to collect items he or she has found in a manner that best aids in their analysis later, at a crime lab.\n\nUse:  This and some other skills can be used to identify items as a method of gaining information.  Use the D20 Modern Action feat on an item to try to identify it.  It is also used to automtically identify the location of traps and to establish their type. Contact a DM for other uses."

The DC to avoid casting failure is equal to 10 + damage received + spell/power level. The caster/psyker receives a -4 penalty to his check if within three meters of an enemy. A DM may require you to take a test during other activities. For other uses contact a DM."

This can help OR hurt a PC.\nUse: Target an NPC to try to receive a +4 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Perform for 2 minutes.  DC is 25; roll is made with a bonus of the PC's Reputation + the NPC's Intelligence modifier.  Note that a DM or a module may be set to apply this as a PENALTY if you would have a bad reputation with someone instead of a positive one.\nTarget self to learn your own Reputation and to make a generic Reputation check whose results will be reported to all DM's.\n\nWealth:\nEvery character has a Wealth bonus that reflects his or her buying power—a composite of income, credit rating, and savings. If used by a particular module, it completely replaces Gold.  A character’s Wealth bonus serves as the basis of the character’s Wealth check, which is used to purchase equipment and services for the character.\nUse:  Used automatically at stores that use the Wealth system.

Because of the unique balance of the saber, with all its weight in the hilt and with a strong gyroscopic effect, it is very difficult for the untrained to wield. In the hands of an expert in tune with the Force, such as the Jedi or their fallen brethren the Sith, the lightsaber is a weapon to be greatly respected, even feared.

The attraction can be toward a particular person, an object, an action, or an event. The power’s target takes reasonable steps to meet, get close to, attend, find, or perform the object of its implanted attraction. For the purposes of this power, “reasonable” means that while fascinated, the target doesn’t suffer from blind obsession. The target will not undertake obviously self-destructive actions. The subject can still recognize danger, but will not flee unless the threat is immediate. If the manifester makes the target feel an attraction to the manifester, the manifester can’t command the subject indiscriminately, although he or she will be willing to listen to the manifester (even if the subject disagrees).

A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. The manifester can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down up to 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. The manifester can’t move the recipient horizontally, but the subject could push or pull his or her way provided there is a surface to grasp (generally at half its base speed). A levitating creature who attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds him or herself increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of –1, the second –2, and so on, up to a maximum penalty of –5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1."

A negated power ends as if its duration had expired. Negate psionics can negate (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as psionic powers. Negate psionics affects spell-like abilities just as it affects powers (and spells). A manifester can’t use negate psionics to undo the effects of any power with instantaneous duration.\nThe manifester chooses to use negate psionics in one of two ways: a targeted negation or an area negation:\nTargeted Negation: One object, creature, or power is the target of the power. The manifester makes a negation check against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. A negation check is 1d20 + 1 per manifester level against a DC of 11 + the manifester level of the power to be negated.\nIf the object that targeted is a psionic item, the manifester makes a negation check against the item’s manifester level. If the manifester succeeds, all the item’s psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own.\nA suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect.\nThe manifester automatically succeed on the negation check against any power that he or she manifested his or herself.\nArea Negation: The power affects everything within a 30-foot radius.\nFor each creature that is the target of one or more powers, the manifester makes a negation check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that fails, he or she makes negation checks against progressively weaker powers until he or she negates one power (which discharges the negate psionics so far as that target is concerned) or fails all his or her checks. The creature’s psionic items are not affected.\nFor each object that is the target of one or more powers, the manifester makes negation checks as with creatures. Psionic items are not affected by area negations.\nFor each ongoing power with an area centered within the negate psionics target area, the manifester makes a negation check to negate the power.\nFor each ongoing power whose area overlaps with that of the negation, the manifester makes a negation check to end the effect, but only within the area of the negate psionics."

The target gains a bonus of +1 to +4 on his or her saving throw, depending on the magnitude of dissonance create by an out-of-context memory, as determined by the GM.

They are often chained together and placed in front of field  fortifications, thus stopping the advance of the enemy. Having to clear the CdF away in order to continue to advance, exposes the enemy, causing them to be under fire that much longer. Of course chevaux de frise could be destroyed, just like any other wooden obstacle, by artillery."

This in turn, causing the long side to rise quickly. A sling attached to the end of the long side of the beam whips over, releases itself and hurls the projectile it held. The two smaller hutches permit easier transport and assembly, also giving excellent horizontal accuracy due to their superior balance. This particular design requires about 4 individuals to operate and can hurl, 80Kg stones for a distance of about 150 meters. It's rate of fire is five to six times higher than that of the  regular single hutch Trebuchet. In the world of counterweight trebuchets, this one can be considered as top dog."

This particular design has the triangle in a horizontal arrangement. The advantages of this design is that all the pullers' ropes are joined to the beam at the same height, so they all reach their maximum leverage and pull at the same moment of the launch -  giving a potential for a more explosive effort. The triangle also supports the axle, making it easier to build the axle assembly rigid. Movement here can have a large effect on the side-to-side accuracy of the machine. The major disadvantages are that the pullers all reach the point where their efforts have no effect (when their ropes are in line with the beam) at the same time, after which the beam is coasting. The engine has very fast reload time. With a crew of 3, This  particular machine can shoot several times a minute, projectiles of about 10Kg to a distance of about 50 meters. Also since this type has a single upright beam and is very small, construction is very fast and very easy."

Once the chamber is deemed to be sufficiently large, the combustible material is set on fire and the miners withdraw. The supporting props eventually burn through and the wall collapses into the chamber. Once a mine is begun, the only defense against it is ounter-mining; i.e. the defenders dig their own tunnel hoping to break in to that of the besiegers and halt its construction or try to flood it. Of course, a good moat can prevent mining altogether."

The mangonneau is an enormous machine which requires the presence of 12 artillerists and  a chief of operation. The lever is lowered using a winch operated  by two wheels, six people are necessary because the counterweight  weighs several tons. When the lever is lowered the pocket of the  sling can be armed with a large stone ball or even several stones. The chief of operation gives the signal, the lever is released and  a group of gunners are suspended on the cords and accelerate the  upswing of the sling. The aiming process is rather long and one  must often carry out many tests. This machine can launch a heavy  projectile of about 100Kg only every approximately two hours, but  as soon as the calibration is finished the damage caused to fortifications is considerable. The projectile can reach a distance  of up to 150 meters. The Rather complicated nature of the reloading mechanism and the  enormous counterweight, produce a great deal of stress on the  frame, this in turn, massively reduces the life span of the mechanism."

They aren't particularly known for innovating technology but they make up with that by iterating and gradually improving them over time.\n\nThey are cordial with most of the races in the Pangalactic Federation but have very little standing politically. That's just fine for them - they have no interest in such games, preferring to develop and build devices instead.\n\nThey regard the Elandarians poorly as they were responsible for bio-engineering the Octifex and dumped the results of their failed experiments upon the Arloxen homeworld of Oix'gana. \n\nThey view the Octifex as a blight on their planet and a drain on their precious resources. The Arloxen eventually banished the Octifex from their planet.\n\nThe Nodians are viewed favorably by the Arloxen as they have established lucrative trade routes between the two species. Arloxen wouldn't make as many advances in engineering were it not for the Nodians providing them with the resources.\n\nArloxen view humans generally favorably, although they do find their behaviors quite unpredictable at times. Just the same, relations remain on good terms."

Less sophisticated species (as the Elandarians would put it) refer to the results of this technology as magic.\n\nThough they are brilliant scientists, the Elandarians have a sordid history of dumping their failed experiments and creating literal \"humanoid waste\". One such example of this is with the Octifex, who they transported and left on the Arloxen homeworld.\n\nThe Elandarians hold a seat on the Pangalactic Federation council. Their position on the council ensures they have continued freedom to advance their bio-engineering technology.\n\nElandarians view the Humans and Nodians generally favorably. They find both species beneficial in one way or another to the advancement of their technology and society.\n\nThe Octifex are viewed as trash - failed experiments which they cannot rid themselves.

The Nodians revere Sol as a celestial god, believing that it is He who has granted them the greatest fortune in the universe. \n\nIt is unknown who - or what - created Sol and all attempts to approach it have ended in the disappearance of the ship and its crew.\n\n\"Live and let live\" is the motto the Nodians borrow from the Humans.

This would eventually be known as the Octifex War and carried on for several years before the newly-formed Pangalactic Federation stepped in to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe Octifex were banished from Elandaria and sent to Oix'gana, much to the dismay of the native denizens Arloxen. The Octifex lived on the Oix'gana just long enough to secure enough ships and supplies to leave.\n\nThey now roam the galaxy in their fleet of ships, working odd jobs for the seedy underworld.\n\nThe Octifex have a generally negative view towards most of the council races. However, they are fairly close to the Nodians who serve as their suppliers of raw materials and resources."

They, along with the Nodians and Zukes, formed the Pangalactic Federation (PGF) which is charged with peacekeeping, policing, and law making.\n\nAlthough originally from Earth, the majority of humans live on Zheckshan Prime which also happens to be where the PGF Headquarters are located.\n\nPolitically, humans are responsible for maintaining relationships will all species throughout the galaxy. This comes with mixed success and is an ongoing challenge for them."

They believe each individual's actions contribute to their destiny, building upon past successes and failures to drive them towards their fates.\n\nMirialans place a unique, often geometrically repeated tattoo on their face and hands to signify that they have completed a certain test or task, or achieved sufficient aptitude for a certain skill. The number of tattoos thus often act as a good indicator of how mature and/or skilled a Mirialan is.\n\nBecause the more markings bring about a form of status, Mirialan society is stratified and allows the heavily marked citizens to access greater opportunities. Despite its importance, most Mirialans do not know the entirety of the tattoo lexicon due to its complexity. The interaction between placement and positioning of the shapes is incredibly subtle and changes meaning greatly.\n\n Within their belief system is the view that individual actions ripple through the Force, also affecting the destiny of the species as a whole. Because the Force is understood through the notion of the Cosmic Force on a basic level, the cultural significance of the energy is defined as fate. Those who are not sensitive to its call still have faith in fate, and feel that it guides their lives."

Their skin spans a vast array of colors, including, but not limited to, orange, green, red, white, and yellow.\n\nUnlike most humanoids, Togruta are known to have multiple stomachs, but their most notable features were the large organic head formations upon their heads; two large cone-like horns called montrals atop their skull, and three lekku, also known as headtails, that sprouted downward.\n\nMembers of the species, particularly those from Shili, were fiercely protective of their world and its surrounding moons, and they regarded the ground beneath their feet sacred. Because of this, a number of Togruta would elect to remain barefoot, only wearing boots while off-world. "

They possessed large pupil-less eyes that could see in infrared spectrum, slender snouts, pointed ears, twin saucer-like antennae that detected vibrations atop their heads, and a ridge of spines cresting their skulls. Green scales (sometimes yellow or turquoise) covered their bodies, and their skin had a rough, pebbly texture, except on the snout and hands. They are cold blooded and have blood of a green color. The flexible snouts augmented the Rodians' finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the spectrum. This allowed the Rodians to visually detect the body heat of their hidden prey emanating from within the darkness.\n\nRodian culture was obsessed with violence and death, due to behaviors and practices that were ingrained since their earliest ancestry. Their densely packed jungle homeworld was ill-suited for agriculture, requiring Rodians to compete with vicious predators for most of their food. Some of these predators, such as ghests, could wipe out entire Rodian villages. As the Rodians developed cunning hunting tactics to survive, the hunt became central to their culture. Eventually they began to hunt each other in various wars and gladiatorial contests.\n\nFor what many would consider a vicious and bloodthirsty species, Rodians were renowned for their drama. Rodian Theater began as a simple series of staged fights, encouraged to burn off their aggression. Over time, it developed into a vibrant—albeit violent—theatrical tradition. The Rodian people managed to produce artists, merchants, and politicians who were found even among the upper classes of the Core Worlds. Rodians greeted or showed respect to others with a salute consisting of an open-palmed hand across the chest, either with one or both arms. "

Their skin ranged in color from peach to a crimson red. Most had dark, black eyes, although some were born with silver irises, a mark that was often seen as an affinity for the Force.\n\nDue to Dorin having a unique atmosphere composed of helium and a gas unique to their world, the Kel Dors were forced to wear an antiox breath mask and protective goggles whenever in atmospheres of a different composition. This equipment protected them from carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen, which were fatal to a Kel Dor. The breathing mask also helped to amplify the Kel Dor's voice, as they were forced to shout to produce any sound when out of their native atmosphere. Without their protective goggles, Kel Dors were considered effectively blind when away from Dorin. They were also able to survive in the vacuum of space for a short time, though it was unknown exactly how long they could withstand it.\n\nThe Kel Dors were aware of and used the Force long before they joined the Galactic Republic and the Jedi. This proud Force tradition was known as the Baran Do Sages. The Baran Do Sages often acted as advisers to rich and powerful Kel Dor families. Kel Dors were noted for their simple approach to justice, and they typically saw moral issues in black and white. On the one hand, the Kel Dor were noted for their hospitality, they would never turn away a stranger in need. Yet, Kel Dors were not averse to taking the law into their own hands, and had no compunctions about putting to death a thief who was merely stealing to feed himself.\n\nKel Dor surnames, like Human surnames, were based on ancient family trades or jobs, or even a description of a particularly famous Kel Dor in the family. The Koon family name, for example, meant 'explorer'. Kel Dor names tended to be short, usually monosyllabic, due to an ancient superstition about the \\\"wind spirits\\\" of Dorin. No one believed in this myth for thousands of years, but the effect it had on Kel Dor naming conventions remained."
