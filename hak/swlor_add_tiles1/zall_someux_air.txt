   Airships!

   April 19th, 2004

   version 1.1

   Tested with HotU  version 1.62 (with SOU)

   First of all, I'd like to thank the folks at CODI and DLA. I could not
   have made this hak without their help.

   The idea of making airships was something that poped up in the
   community IRC channels, and I decided that given my past experience
   with ship models (the Caravels and Longships haks) this ought to be
   fairly straight forward. Boy, was I in for a surprise.

   The basic design did indeed take fairly little effort to make and was
   done in about 10 hours or so. Slicing and Porting the the model a
   couple of hours more, an extra week or so to do all the tileset
   variations and maybe another day for the mini-map icons. I was sitting
   comfortably and ready to start QA on the thing, I figured 'well,
   shouldn't take more than a day or two'. By this time, I was fairly
   familiar with the game engine's shadow casting quirky behavior (having
   done the previous two tile haks). But I could not have seen what was
   coming. For all my efforts, I could not make the night-time shadow
   casting system to work properly. I must've wasted weeks on it, trying
   hundreds of solutions, dozens of permutations for each, and still the
   accursed thing wasn't right.

   Why am I bothering you with this ? partly to blow off steam (the
   regular non-gnome way) and maybe to issue a word of warning for
   complacent folks out there. Modeling stuff for games can be very
   frustrating.

   A whole bunch of weeks later (and a little less hair in my scalp) I
   came to the conclusion that I was right all along and that the problem
   was probably a Shadow casting issue I had nothing to do with (or do
   anything about for that matter) since it was most likely a game Engine
   flaw.

   What's then the moral of this rather tiresome story ? well, Eat more
   turnips ! no wait, It's that you shouldn't give up. Although I may have
   wasted weeks with this futile exercise I did learn one importat lesson:
   life sucks !


   Content

   The Tile hak (airships.hak) includes 18 airship tile groups (16
   models): Three for the rural tileset, Three for the city exterior
   tileset, Two for the Forest tileset, Three for the Rural Winter
   tileset, Two for the Desert tileset, Three for the Underdark tileset
   and Two for the Frozen Wastes tileset. And Each is a 3x1 tile-group.


   Installation


   - Extract the airships.hak file into your "Hak" folder, inside your NWN
   directory.


   To add the airships into a new module you create, go to Edit > Module
   Properties, then over to the Custom Content tab. Choose the "airships"
   hak, and click Add.



   Airship technical specifications


   Size: big.

   Weight: less than you would expect.

   Powersource: unknown, or very unreliable gnome tinkering stuff.

   Armor: wood.

   Boarding technologies: a rope hanging down.

   Flight operation: depends on the capability of your mage to control the
   weather.

   Range of operation: Till you get sick of turnips or until the ship
   falls apart.



   Tile group Notes


   The Airship tilegroups include several "Animation Loops" that can be
   enabled and disabled within the toolset.


   The Floating Versions have the Following Animations:


   Animation loop 1: Controls the propeller blades' animation. On - for
   turning, off - for static.

   Animation loop 2: Controls the Hind Steam Exhaust port. On - to make
   the Exhaust appear, off - to shut down the iris and retract the exhaust
   apparatus.

   Animation loop 3: Controls the the Steam emitter at the Exhaust port.
   On - to start the steam animation, off - to stop it. (notice, that if
   you apply this without animation loop 2 being on, the exhaust apparatus
   will be extracted to let the steam out, overriding animation loop 2)


   The Docked Versions have the Following Animations:


   Animation loop 1: Controls the Hind Steam Exhaust port. On - to make
   the Exhaust appear, off - to shut down the iris and retract the exhaust
   apparatus.


   Both Docked and floating versions have day/night window animations.



   Editing the tile Hak Pak


   Due to the sheer number of variations, I will not explain how to reduce
   the hak size for each possible permutation, Instead I will attempt to
   summarize the necessary data in an easily readable format.

   Following then, is a table summarization of each tile group and the
   files associated with it, that you may need to reduce unneeded files
   from the hak pak in order to cut down on "hak pak bloat". You can do
   this by removing the appropriate .mdl .wok and .tga , files listed for
   each tile-group. (notice that the appropriate .set file entries will
   also need to be removed, as well as the respective .itp entries)

   Known Issues
     * Avoid large crowds onboard, this is likely to produce severe
       path-finding problems. Also the ramp at the back side of the ship
       will require manual maneuvering (if you wish to get behind it).
     * There are some shadow casting issues mostly during nighttime,
       especially if you walk around with a torch or a light spell. There
       is a way around it, if you turn area lighting to Interior dark you
       can simulate nighttime dynamic shadow casting (aka moon-shadows),
       This however will not turn nighttime animations on (the window will
       not switch to nighttime setting). Unfortunately, there is little to
       be done about it, (unless BW update this particular bug).
     * Clipping may occur when moving close to the ropes, side railing,
       ramp or deck-cabin. Fixing this issue would have hampered
       path-finding even more, so I had to compromise.
     * In General, this is a relativly high polygon model, so you should
       probably not use a 32x32 city exterrior area with 100 airships :)
